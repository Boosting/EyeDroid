Introduction
---------

EyeDroid is a mobile Android platform eye tracking system designed to be used with a head mounted camera. EyeDroid receives video streaming from the userâ€™s eye as input, process it and sends the resulting 2-axis coordinates to a networked client. Unlike other eye tracking systems which use a stationary processing server, EyeDroid performs all its processing workload in a mobile device and sends the resulting coordinates to a network client. For this reason, EyeDroid supports mobility when used along wearable and mobile devices.
